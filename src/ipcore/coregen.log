WARNING:sim:991 - The project IP instance 'mac_fifo' for IP 'FIFO Generator
   v9.3' was generated with a different version of the IP than is currently in
   the IP Catalog. It was originally generated using IP with the packaged
   timestamp '2012-07-25+18:11'; the IP in the current catalog has a different
   packaged timestamp '2012-11-19+12:39'. This mismatch is due to changes made
   to the IP in the user repositories. It may affect some functionality of the
   IP, if there are differences between these two versions of the IP.
